I developed a minimum viable product (MVP) of this concept in Objective-C and
Parse. The video in this directory is an Airplay recording of the native iOS app

The app uses the Svpply API for product lookups. If A/B is accepted as a
finalist, I'll replace this logic with the appropriate Target API calls.
