Description

**Concept**

My proposed app is called "A/B." It's a polling space for gathering second
opinions about things *we might buy* or *have recently bought*. A/B polls have a
uniform format, made up of:

-   a framing question: "Which of these shall I buy?" "Which of these shall I
    keep?"

-   2 possible answers: A or B. Each has a product image, a caption, and a vote
    button.



**Scenarios**

*In-Store Purchase*

Tracy is trying on dresses in a Target store. She's here alone, while on a lunch
break from her day job. She wants the opinion of friends, and has narrowed her
choices down to two items: a Missoni for Target Sleeveless Sweater Dress and a
Jason Wu for Target Poplin Dress in Navy. She adds a poll with A/B, substituting
a couple self portraits taken in the dressing room mirror for the regular
product images from target.com. She makes the poll private, so only her friends
can see it. As she changes into her work clothes, she sees her phone buzzing
with notifications. 4 of 5 friends so far preferred the Missoni. Done and Done.
She purchases it a few minutes later.



*Recent Purchase*

Sally is assembling her ideal living room on a budget. She purchased two Target
Home Medallion Rugs (one in cream, one in indigo), but only intends to keep one.
She carefully places the cream one in her living room, photographs it, then does
the same for the indigo. She flips between the two photos on her phone and
realizes that she could use a 2nd opinion. So she posts an A/B poll,
substituting the photos she just took for the regular product images on
target.com. Within an hour, she sees a dozen or so votes, from both friends and
strangers, favoring the cream rug. She returns the indigo one the next day.



*Future Purchase*

Sam is shopping for a camera to give his daughter. He loved photography in his
youth, and wants to introduce her to the art. He knows what he'd like to spend,
and has narrowed his choices down to 2 DSLRs, a Nikon and a Canon. So he posts
an A/B poll asking for help deciding. Within a few days, a handful of
thoughtful, informed comments appear on his poll. He taps into the commenters'
profiles and sees that they are camera experts who don't mind sharing their
expertise. He follows them for future reference, and adds the Nikon to his
target.com wishlist.



Value for Everyone
------------------

Everyone in this system gets something out of participating.

-   **Poll Authors** - get a second opinion

-   **Poll Voters** - get to express their opinion. They may feel a sense of
    altruism in helping others have a broader point of view in their purchasing
    decisions.

-   **Target**

    -   gets *demand data* on the products in Target's inventory (which products
        are most wanted, which products are preferred regionally)

    -   gets improved *related product clustering (*"customers frequently
        compared *this* product to *that* product")

    -   gets to identify customers of influence, based on number of followers
        and votes

    -   gets to identify expert users, based on commenting activity



Additionally, unlike many "like economies", this is a completely open data
platform. Everyone in the system can look at the data of anyone else in the
system.
