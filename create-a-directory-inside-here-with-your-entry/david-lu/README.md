Description
-----------



**Concept**

My proposed app is called "A/B." It's a polling space for gathering second
opinions about the things *we might buy* or *have recently bought*. A/B polls
have a uniform format, possessing:

-   a framing question

    -   "Which of these shall I buy?" "Which of these shall I keep?"

-   2 possible answers ("a" or "b")

    -   each has a product image and caption



**The Feed**

Polls appear in an Instagram-like, vertically scrolling feed. Big product images
fill up the screen. One can switch between "All Polls" and "Polls I follow" by
tapping or swiping the header, a la Sparrow.



**Voting**

One swipes horizontally between A or B product images for each poll. To vote,
one taps a checkmark button on either image. When one has voted, the
non-selected checkmark button disappears, and the tapped checkmark takes on a
selected state. To unvote, one taps the selected checkmark button again.



Immediately after voting, a green button appears beneath the poll, labeled,
"Care to say why?" One might tap this to view the Poll Detail, where one might
add commentary on the poll.



**Poll Detail**

The Poll Detail offers a variety of data about the poll, including

-   A bar graph of the current votes, with voter attribution beneath

-   A map of where votes are coming from

-   A comments area where conversation around poll content can emerge



**User Detail**

From anywhere in the app, one might tap a user's avatar to arrive at a User
Detail screen. This screen, too, has a variety of data, including:

-   A measure of sameness

    -   "You and this user agree on 33% of the polls you have both taken"

-   Polls this user has posted

-   Polls this user has voted on

-   Following

-   Followers



Value for Everyone
------------------

Everyone in this system gets something out of participating.

-   **Poll Authors** - get a second opinion

-   **Poll Voters** - get to express their opinion. They may feel a sense of
    altruism in helping others have a broader point of view in their purchasing
    decisions.

-   **Target and the Brands It Carries **-

    -   get *demand data* on the products in Target's inventory

        -   which products are most wanted

        -   which products are preferred regionally

    -   get improved *related product clustering*

        -   "customers frequently compared *this* product to *that* product"

    -   get to identify customers of influence — based on number of followers
        and votes

    -   get to identify expert users — based on commenting activity



Additionally, unlike many "like economies", this is a completely open data
platform. Everyone in the system can look at the data of anyone else in the
system. There is an implied honesty here.
