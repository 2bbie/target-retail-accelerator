Description
-----------



**Concept**

My proposed app is called "A/B." It's a polling space for gathering second
opinions about the things *we might buy* or *have recently bought*. A/B polls
have a uniform format, made up of:

-   a framing question: "Which of these shall I buy?" "Which of these shall I
    keep?"

-   2 possible answers: A or B. Each has a product image and caption



**Scenarios**



TBD



Value for Everyone
------------------

Everyone in this system gets something out of participating.

-   **Poll Authors** - get a second opinion

-   **Poll Voters** - get to express their opinion. They may feel a sense of
    altruism in helping others have a broader point of view in their purchasing
    decisions.

-   **Target**

    -   gets *demand data* on the products in Target's inventory (which products
        are most wanted, which products are preferred regionally)

    -   gets improved *related product clustering (*"customers frequently
        compared *this* product to *that* product")

    -   gets to identify customers of influence, based on number of followers
        and votes

    -   gets to identify expert users, based on commenting activity



Additionally, unlike many "like economies", this is a completely open data
platform. Everyone in the system can look at the data of anyone else in the
system. There is an implied honesty here.
