**00 / Splash Screen**



**01 / Add Poll**

One adds a framing question for the poll by tapping in the white field. Each A
or B answer has a caption field, where one can type each product's name.
Pollsters have the option of searching for a matching product when typing. If
one selects a product from the matched results, the image is populated with an
existing product image.



Pollsters can add their own image to each A or B answer. One taps the camera
button in the lower left corner of each image to get an action sheet with
options to: Take Photo, Choose Photo, or Search for Product.



**02 / Feed, "A" option showing**

Polls appear in an Instagram-like, vertically scrolling feed. Big product images
fill the screen. One can switch between "All Polls" and "Polls I follow" by
tapping or swiping the header, a la Sparrow.



**03 / Feed, "B" option showing**

One swipes horizontally between A or B product images for each poll. To vote,
one taps a checkmark button on either image. When one has voted, the
non-selected checkmark button disappears, and the tapped checkmark takes on a
selected state. To unvote, one taps the selected checkmark button again.



**04 / Feed, scrolled down**

Note that the header scrolls off screen, allowing poll content to become the
primary read.

Immediately after voting, a green button appears beneath the poll, labeled,
"Care to say why?" One might tap this to view the Poll Detail, where one might
add commentary on the poll.



**05 / Hamburger, Notifications**

Notifications and Log Out affordances appear in this panel.



**06 / Poll Detail**

**07 / Poll Detail, scrolled down**

The Poll Detail offers a variety of data about the poll, including

-   A bar graph of the current votes, with voter attribution beneath

-   A map of where votes are coming from

-   A comments area where conversation around poll content can emerge



**08 / User Detail**

From anywhere in the app, one might tap a user's avatar to arrive at a User
Detail screen. This screen, too, has a variety of data, including:

-   A measure of sameness: "You and this user agree on 33% of the polls you have
    both taken"

-   Polls this user has posted

-   Polls this user has voted on

-   Following

-   Followers



One can follow or unfollow a user from this screen.



**09 / Most Wanted Products, Web Tool**

A/B can be thought of as a product demand data platform. Here is a web tool that
might allow Target staff to see which products are trending. It's searchable:
the "all products" text is actually a form field.
