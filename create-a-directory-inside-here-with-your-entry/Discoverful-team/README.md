# Target Showroom App

Target Showroom app uses augmented reality technology on mobile devices to give customers much better sense about whether or not the products will fit in their own environment.
By simply pointing your iPhone to your room, you can visually pick furniture, lamp, home décor, etc. and see how they look like in your room. It’s also a great tool for you to design your home and collect feedback from family and friends. 
Target store and web site have many home furnishing and decoration products with quality photos. But finding the right sofa or lamp for a room is still a challenging task because customers have to imagine how they will look like after being placed at specific locations inside the room. Target Showroom app is the perfect solution to solve this problem.
