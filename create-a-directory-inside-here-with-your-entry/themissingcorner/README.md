## Overview
Retail has been around for thousands of years, and through out time, there has been a massive technology improvement. We now see great innovation in supply chain management, shippings, web-store, mobile-store, etc. However, most of those technology are being used in the back of the system, or it's simply a e-commerce thing that had been around for a decade. People is long overdue for a new shopping experience and we're here just to do that.

## What is Targeter
